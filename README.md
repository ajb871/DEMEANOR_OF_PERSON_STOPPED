#DEMEANOR_OF_PERSON_STOPPED

This project began with the intent of visualizing the disproportional targeting of minorities through the "Stop, Question, and Frisk" program, using NYC OpenData from the NYPD.

I discovered these reports included a heading called "demeanor of person stopped". While words like "nervous", and "normal" show up most frequently, I was interested to use this data to see in how the language the officers used to describe the "suspects" related to their race, age, build, and gender.

Work in progress.
